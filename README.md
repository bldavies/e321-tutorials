# e321-tutorials

This repository contains the tutorial and exam questions that I wrote as the teaching assistant for [the undergraduate microeconomic theory course][e321] at the University of Canterbury in early 2017.

`questions.pdf` presents the full set of questions while `solutions.pdf` presents my suggested solutions (which may contain errors).
I obtain the latter by compiling `questions.tex` after uncommenting the `\showsols` command on line 11.
The `inputs` folder contains the TeX source for each question and solution set, organised by tutorial number.
