# e321-tutorials

This repository contains the TeX files for the tutorial and exam questions that I wrote as the teaching assistant for [Microeconomic Analysis][e321] in early 2017.

The full set of questions can be viewed in `questions.pdf` while my suggested solutions are offered in `solutions.pdf`.
The latter is obtained by compiling `questions.tex` after uncommenting the `\showsols` command on line 11.
The TeX sources for the questions themselves, organised by tutorial number, are provided in the `inputs` folder.
